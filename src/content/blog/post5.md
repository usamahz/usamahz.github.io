Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is a set of practices that combines machine learning, DevOps, and data engineering to deploy and maintain ML systems in production. This post explores the key aspects of MLOps and its importance in modern AI systems.

## Core Components

MLOps encompasses several key areas:

1. **Version Control**
   - Code versioning
   - Model versioning
   - Data versioning
   - Experiment tracking

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated testing
   - Model validation
   - Deployment automation
   - Monitoring and alerting
