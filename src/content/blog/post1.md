The transformer architecture has revolutionized natural language processing and has become the foundation for many state-of-the-art models. This post explores the key components and principles behind this groundbreaking architecture.

## Core Components

The transformer architecture consists of several key components that work together to process sequential data:

1. **Self-Attention Mechanism**
   - Enables the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input
   - Computes attention scores between all pairs of tokens
   - Allows for capturing long-range dependencies

2. **Multi-Head Attention**
   - Splits the input into multiple parallel attention heads
   - Each head can focus on different aspects of the input
   - Improves the model's ability to capture various types of relationships

3. **Positional Encoding**
   - Adds position information to the input embeddings
   - Enables the model to understand the order of tokens
   - Uses sine and cosine functions for position representation

## Applications

Transformers have found applications in various domains:

- Natural Language Processing
  - Machine Translation
  - Text Generation
  - Question Answering
  - Sentiment Analysis

- Computer Vision
  - Image Classification
