Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been revolutionized by transformer models, enabling unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human language. This post explores modern NLP techniques and their applications.

## Transformer-Based Models

The landscape of NLP is dominated by various transformer architectures:

1. **Encoder-Decoder Models**
   - T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
   - BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers)
   - MarianMT

2. **Encoder-Only Models**
   - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
   - RoBERTa
   - DeBERTa
   - ELECTRA

3. **Decoder-Only Models**
   - GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
   - GPT-2
   - GPT-3
   - PaLM
